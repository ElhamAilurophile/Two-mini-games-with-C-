# Two Mini-Games with C++
These mini-games were created during high school (2014-2015) as part of school projects.

1) Loogooli: The character, Loogooli, tries to catch apples falling from the sky.
2) Hidden Ball: The game features three cups, with a ball hidden under one. The cups move around, and the player must guess which cup holds the ball.
