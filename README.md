# Two-mini-games-with-Cpp
I made them when I was at high school for school projects (2014-2015).
Loogooli: The character named Loogooli is trying to get apples that falling from sky.
Hidden Ball: There are three cups and one ball. Ball hidden under a cup and cups start moving. Player should guess the cup that hiding the ball.
